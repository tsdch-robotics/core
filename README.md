# core

This repository contains code and resources that are useful across teams. 

**CAUTION:** in order to use a Java class from this repo, you must copy it into your project directory (usually the `opmodes` directory).

## Contributing

1. Create a new directory for your contribution*. Names should be short, descriptive, and `UpperCamelCased`.
  - **Exceptions*: Graphic assets should go under `gfx`; place documentation under `doc`.
2. Put your files, as well as a `README.md` file, inside the project directory.
  - on the very first line of text files (code and documentation), make sure to put a comment with your name and the date
  - format this comment like so: `// written by Patrick Knight, 2016-02-21`
  - the README should include information about any setup/prerequisites your project needs

While not strictly necessary, creating a new branch for your contribution and issuing a pull request is the "nice", preferred way to merge new contributions into the master branch.
